    <!-- The <p> tag defines a paragraph element in HTML -->
    <p>
        This is a basic paragraph element. The &lt;p&gt; tag automatically adds some margin space 
        before and after the content, creating natural spacing between paragraphs. This helps improve
        readability and document structure.
    </p>

    <!-- The <hr> tag creates a horizontal line, useful for thematic breaks -->
    <hr>

    <p>
        This second paragraph demonstrates different text formatting and line breaks. 
        The &lt;br&gt; tag forces a line break within a paragraph, unlike the &lt;p&gt; tag 
        which creates a new paragraph block.<br>
        This line appears after a break tag.<br>
        And this is another line after another break tag.
    </p>

    <!-- Additional paragraph with formatting examples -->
    <p>
        Paragraphs are block-level elements, meaning they take up the full width available
        and start on a new line. They're essential for:
        • Organizing content
        • Improving readability
        • Maintaining proper document structure
