    <h1>HTML Comments</h1>
    
    <!-- This is a single line comment -->
    <p>Comments are not displayed in the browser</p>

    <!-- 
        This is a multi-line comment
        HTML comments start with <!-- and end with -->
        They are useful for:
        1. Documenting your code
        2. Debugging
        3. Temporarily disabling content
    -->
    <p>Comments help other developers understand your code</p>

    <!-- Comments can contain <p>HTML tags</p> and special characters !@#$ -->
    <p>But they won't be rendered by the browser</p>

    <!--
        Best Practices:
        - Keep comments clear and concise
        - Use them to explain complex code sections
        - Don't overuse comments
        - Remove debugging comments before production
